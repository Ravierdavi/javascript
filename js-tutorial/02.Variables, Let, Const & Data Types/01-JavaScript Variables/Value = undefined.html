        // In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.

        // A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.

        // The variable carName will have the value undefined after the execution of this statement:

        let carName

        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName
