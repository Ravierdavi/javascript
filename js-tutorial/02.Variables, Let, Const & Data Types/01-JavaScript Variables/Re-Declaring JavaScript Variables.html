    <h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>

    <p>If you re-declare a JavaScript variable (only works with the var variable), it will not lose its value.</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        // If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.

        // The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:
        
        var carName = "Pedro Paulo"
        var carName
        
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName

        //         You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.

        // This will not work:

        /*
        let name = "Dorival Delicio"
        let name
        */
    </script>
