    <h2>JavaScript Hoisting</h2>

    <p>With <b>var</b>, you can use a variable before it is declared:</p>

    <p id="demo1"></p>

    <p>With <b>let</b>, you cannot use a variable before it is declared.</p>

    <p id="demo2"></p>

    <script>
        // Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.

        // Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared:

        carName = "Volvo"
        document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = carName

        // If you want to learn more about hoisting, study the chapter JavaScript Hoisting.

        // Variables defined with let are also hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

        // Meaning: Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError:

        try {
            carName = "Saab";
            let carName = "Volvo";
        }
        catch(err) {
            document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = err;
        }
